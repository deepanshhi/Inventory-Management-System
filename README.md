# Inventory Management System

The **Inventory Management System** is a simple Java application designed to manage a list of items with their associated quantities and prices. It allows users to add, update, remove, and display items in the inventory. This project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts, including the use of collections like `TreeMap`, `HashMap`, and `ArrayList`.

## Features

- Add new items to the inventory.
- Update existing items' quantity and price.
- Remove items from the inventory.
- Display all items in the inventory.
- Use of multiple data structures to manage and manipulate inventory data (`TreeMap`, `HashMap`, `ArrayList`).

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language for the core application.
- **Collections**: `TreeMap`, `HashMap`, `ArrayList` for inventory management.
- **Scanner**: For user input.

## Project Structure

The project is composed of two main classes:

- **Item.java**: Represents the details of an inventory item (name, quantity, price).
- **InventoryManagementSystem.java**: Manages the inventory, handling user input and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on items.

## How to Run the Program

1. Ensure you have [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the repository from GitHub.
3. Navigate to the project folder and compile the Java files using:

   ```bash
   javac InventoryManagementSystem.java
4. Run the program with:
   ```bash
   java InventoryManagementSystem
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to manage your inventory.

   Enter price: 1200.50                   
   Item added successfully! 


## Data Structures Used

TreeMap: Used to store inventory items in alphabetical order by item name.                      
HashMap: Provides fast access to inventory quantities.                            
ArrayList: Maintains the list of items for easy iteration and display.
